Part Cooling for Elegoo Neptune 3 - 3 Pro - 3 Plus - 3 Max 

Hero Me Gen7 based part cooling for the completely stock printhead assemblies on these printers. 

Go to this directory in the Zip:

/Gantry Adapters/Elegoo Neptune/Neptune 3-Pro-Plus-Max STOCK/

In there you will find a unique Hero Me Gen7 part cooling solution that is mixed with the stock shroud of these printers. 

The only options are ADXL345 mounts. None of the Hero Me Gen7 components will work on these as they do not use the Hero Me Gen7 Base as a core.
